# HTTP/3 Node.js Package

This package provides an implementation of HTTP/3 over UDP using Node.js. It allows you to create secure, encrypted
communication channels between clients and servers using the latest HTTP/3 protocol.

## Features

- **HTTP/3 over UDP**: Implements the latest HTTP/3 protocol with UDP.
- **TLS Encryption**: Secure communication using TLS.
- **Session Management**: Supports session handling with session IDs.
- **Chunked Messaging**: Efficient handling of large messages by sending them in chunks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting to control the flow of requests.

## Installation

You can install this package using npm:

```bash
npm install http3-package
```

## Usage

### Server Example

```javascript
const Http3Server = require('http3-package/src/core/http3server');

const server = new Http3Server('127.0.0.1', 4434, 'path/to/server-cert.pem', 'path/to/server-key.pem');

server.setRequestHandler(async (request) => {
    console.log('Received request:', request);

    // Handle request based on method
    let response;
    if (request.method === 'GET') {
        response = {body: 'Hello, HTTP/3 with UDP! (GET)'};
    } else if (request.method === 'POST') {
        response = {body: 'Data received and processed! (POST)', data: request.payload};
    }
    return response;
});

console.log('HTTP/3 server is running');
```

### Client Example

```javascript
const Http3Client = require('http3-package/src/core/http3client');

const client = new Http3Client('localhost', 4434, 'path/to/client-cert.pem', 'path/to/client-key.pem');

const sendRequest = async () => {
    await client.initializeSession();

    const method = 'POST';
    const path = '/example';
    const headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    };
    const body = {
        key: 'value'
    };

    await client.sendHttpRequest(method, path, headers, body);
    console.log('HTTP/3 request sent.');
};

sendRequest();
```

## Configuration

Before starting the HTTP/3 server and client, you need to set up the stunnel configurations.

### 1. Environment Variables

You can set the following environment variables or you will be prompted to enter them during the setup:

- `SERVER_ACCEPT`: The server's accept address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:5000`).
- `SERVER_CONNECT`: The server's connect address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:4434`).
- `SERVER_CERT`: Path to the server's certificate file (e.g., `path/to/server-cert.pem`).
- `SERVER_KEY`: Path to the server's private key file (e.g., `path/to/server-key.pem`).
- `CLIENT_ACCEPT`: The client's accept address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:5001`).
- `CLIENT_CONNECT`: The client's connect address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:5000`).
- `CLIENT_CERT`: Path to the client's certificate file (e.g., `path/to/client-cert.pem`).
- `CLIENT_KEY`: Path to the client's private key file (e.g., `path/to/client-key.pem`).

### 2. Running the Setup Script

Run the following command to generate the stunnel configuration files:

```bash
node scripts/setupStunnel.js
```

This script will create the necessary stunnel configuration files based on your environment variables or inputs.

## Running the Server and Client

After setting up the stunnel configuration, you can start the server and client as follows:

### Starting the Server

```bash
node server-example.js
```

### Starting the Client

```bash
node client-example.js
```

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that your TLS certificates are securely generated and stored.
- Regularly update your dependencies to ensure that your implementation remains secure.
